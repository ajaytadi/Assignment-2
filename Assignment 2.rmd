```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(skimr)
```


### Load dataset and naming it as  dinner.

```{r}

dinner <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-20/thanksgiving_meals.csv")

```

### 1. Display the first 10 rows of the dataset using RMarkdown

```{r 10 rows}
dinner %>% head(10) %>% 
  kable()
```

### 2. Use fct_reorder and parse_number functions to create a factor variable family_income

```{r }

dinner <- dinner %>%
       mutate(family_income = fct_reorder(family_income, parse_number(family_income)))

```

### 3. Generate the general statistics of the dataset using summary() and skim() function.

```{r }

skim(dinner) %>% 
  kable()

summary(dinner) %>% 
  kable()

```

### 4. What is the number of people who celebrate?

```{r}

dinner %>% filter(celebrate == "Yes") %>% 
count(celebrate, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  kable()

```


### 5. What are categories and stats for each main dish served and the method it is prepared?
### 6. Create a data viz showing this in the most evident way. Provide your own legend and use themes.


```{r }

dinner %>%  count(main_dish, main_prep, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(main_dish != "NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n,main_prep,fill = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~main_dish) +
  labs(x = "Number of People", y = "Method of Preparation ", title = "Main Dish and Method of Preparation", caption = "Image: Graph") 

```

### 7. How many use cranberry sauce? How many use gravy?

```{r}

dinner %>%  count(cranberry, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  kable()
dinner %>% filter(gravy == "Yes") %>% 
  count (gravy,sort = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() 
```


### 8. What is the distribution of those who celebrate across income ranges
### 9. Present this information in the most evident way on the data viz.

```{r}

dinner %>% filter(celebrate == "Yes") %>%  
  count(family_income, celebrate, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, family_income, fill = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Number of People Celebrate", y = "Average Salary Income ", title = "Celebration Across Income Ranges", caption = "Image: Graph")

```


### 10. What are the most common pies, sides, and desserts?

```{r }

pie <- dinner %>% 
  select(starts_with("pie"), -pie13) %>% 
  gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(type == "pie9")


sides <- dinner %>% 
  select(starts_with("side")) %>% 
  gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(type == "side9")

desserts <- dinner %>% 
  select(starts_with("dessert")) %>% 
  gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>% na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(value != "None") %>% 
  filter(type == "dessert8")
  

```



### 11. Present this information on a data viz


```{r}

commonfoods <- rbind(pie, sides, desserts) 

commonfoods %>% ggplot(aes(type, n, fill = value)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Type of Dish", y = "Number of people", title = "Most common Dessert, Pie,and Side", caption = "Image: Graph") +
  theme_test()


```

### 12. No Question given in the assignment.

### 13. How do the servings differ by income?
### 14. Present this information on a data viz.

```{r}

dinner %>% count(main_dish, family_income)%>%
  na.omit(main_dish)%>%
  na.omit(family_income)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(main_dish, n, fill = family_income)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(family_income~.,)+
  coord_flip() +
   labs(x = "Main Dishes", y = "Number of people", title = "Servings Differ By Income", caption = "Image: Graph") +
  theme_test()

```
